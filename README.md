## Conclusion and Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following conclusions and recommendations are drawn:

- Key clients fall within the age range of 25-45.
- Gender and marital status do not significantly impact key clients, as top preferred spending categories remain consistent.
- Salaried employees and freelancers are key clients.
- Key client locations: Mumbai, Delhi, and Bengaluru.
- Delhi is a significant market; focus on increasing the client base in this region.
- Festive months (August, September, October) show high spending and income utilization percentages.
- Top preferred spending categories: Bills, Groceries, Electronics, Health and Wellness, and Travel.
- Recommendations: Tailor offers for cashback and lifestyle benefits in the new Mitron Bank credit card line.

This analysis provides valuable insights to Mitron Bank for targeted marketing strategies and personalized offerings to enhance customer engagement and satisfaction.
